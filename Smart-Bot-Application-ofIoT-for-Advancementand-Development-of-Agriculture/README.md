# Smart-Farming-Bot-Using-IOT
Currently, the world needs farmland equivalent to the size of South America to feed the world's population. However, even with this amount of land, an estimated 815 million people still go to bed hungry each night. By the end of 2050, the global population is expected to reach 9 billion, which will only make this challenge more difficult.
Sustainable agriculture and artificial intelligence (AI) can play a key role in addressing this challenge. Sustainable agriculture practices can help to increase crop yields while reducing the environmental impact of farming. AI can be used to develop new farming techniques, improve crop management, and track food production and distribution.
In addition, modern-day cities already contain half of the world's population. This means that the impact of the projected surge in global population will drastically decrease the amount of habitable land available for agriculture.
Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy of India, where nearly 60% of the population depends on it. Therefore, it is essential to find ways to make agriculture more sustainable and efficient in order to feed the growing population.
Here are some specific ways that sustainable agriculture and AI can help to feed the world's growing population:
Sustainable agriculture practices: These practices include using less water and fertilizers, planting cover crops, and rotating crops. These practices can help to increase crop yields while reducing the environmental impact of farming.
AI-powered farming: AI can be used to develop new farming techniques, such as precision agriculture and predictive analytics. Precision agriculture uses sensors to collect data about the soil and plants, which can then be used to apply fertilizers and water more precisely. Predictive analytics can be used to predict crop yields and identify potential problems, such as pests and diseases.
Food production and distribution: AI can be used to track food production and distribution. This information can be used to ensure that food is distributed in a way that minimizes waste and ensures that everyone has access to it.
By adopting sustainable agriculture practices and using AI, we can help to feed the world's growing population while also protecting the environment.

Here are some specific examples of how sustainable agriculture and AI are being used to feed the world:
Precision agriculture uses sensors and satellite data to monitor crops and apply water and fertilizer more precisely. This can help to reduce water use and improve crop yields.
Vertical farming grows crops in vertically stacked layers, which can be located in urban areas or other areas with limited land. This can help to increase food production in areas where land is scarce.
Edible insects are a sustainable source of protein that can be grown on a small amount of land. AI is being used to develop new ways to breed and raise edible insects.
Drones are being used to survey crops, apply pesticides, and deliver seeds. This can help to reduce the labor required for farming and improve crop yields.
These are just a few examples of the many ways that sustainable agriculture and AI are being used to feed the world. As these technologies continue to develop, they will play an increasingly important role in ensuring global food security.
Since agricultural field is declining day by day.In this rapidly changing world already brimming with hunger and agricultural difficulties caused by lack of land, we believe that our solution with underpinnings in sustainable agriculture and artificial intelligence provides a feasible solution

Explaination Working Solution

In order to preserve and monitor the land IOT based robots are used.This is because nearly 90 per cent of the available resources of water are used for irrigation purpose gratuitously.This demand of water may increase in the future decade.To overcome this problem we have designed an IoT based robot named “Smart Agriculture Using Bot” that includes the use of the advanced technology of AI and LI-FI which solves all the real time problems.This project aims to reduce the use of underground water supply and it’s an idea which will replace drip irrigation system. The requirements for drip irrigation are too high like pump station, control valves, etc. These requirements cost high at the time of installation.
IoT-based robots have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by making it more efficient, sustainable, and productive.
Your robot sounds like it could be very effective in reducing water use. By using AI and LI-FI, the robot could be able to monitor the soil moisture levels and adjust the irrigation accordingly. This would help to ensure that crops are getting the water they need, but not more than they need.
The robot could also be used to detect and prevent pests and diseases. This would help to reduce the need for pesticides, which can be harmful to the environment.
Overall, your robot has the potential to make a significant contribution to sustainable agriculture. I'm excited to see how it develops!
Here are some additional benefits of using IoT-based robots in agriculture:
They can collect and analyze data in real time, which can be used to make informed decisions about crop management.
They can be used to automate tasks, such as weeding and harvesting, which can save time and labor.
They can be used to monitor livestock, which can help to improve animal welfare.
They can be used to improve food safety, by detecting and preventing contamination.
As IoT technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of robots in agriculture. These robots have the potential to revolutionize the way we produce food, making it more sustainable and efficient.

Solution Approach

Smart Agricultural bot Using IOT has a smart pump, soil moisture detector, robotic arm, uses LIFI technology. The robot is operated from a distance and it has a robotic arm which carries soil moisture detector to check the moisture level of the land. When the robotic arm is operated, the soil moisture detector checks whether the plant or crop requires water or not. It gives a light signal to solar panel (LIFI TECHNOLOGY) which automatically ON’s the smart pump provided, the water is supplied to the plant. The amount of water supplied to each plant is calculated. The camera for monitoring is kept at the top for video coverage and image processing. The records are sent to databases immediately.The motion detecting sensor is kept back, if any animal or human being is close to it the buzzer beeps and gives them a alert.
The use of LIFI technology is a particularly innovative idea. LIFI is a new wireless technology that uses light to transmit data. This is in contrast to traditional wireless technologies, such as WiFi, which use radio waves. LIFI has several advantages over traditional wireless technologies, including:
It is more secure, as it is difficult to intercept light signals.
It is more energy-efficient, as it uses less power to transmit data.
It is less likely to interfere with other wireless signals.
The use of LIFI in your smart agricultural bot would allow you to transmit data from the soil moisture detector to the smart pump without the need for a wireless router or other infrastructure. This would make the bot more portable and easier to install.
I think your smart agricultural bot has the potential to be a very valuable tool for farmers. It could help them to reduce water use, improve crop yields, and save time and labor. I'm excited to see how it develops!
Here are some other features that could be added to your smart agricultural bot:
A weather sensor to track rainfall and temperature, which could be used to adjust the irrigation schedule.
A pest and disease sensor to detect and prevent pests and diseases.
A yield sensor to track the weight and quality of the crops, which could be used to improve crop management.
A GPS sensor to track the location of the bot, which could be used to automate tasks, such as weeding and harvesting.
As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative features being added to smart agricultural bots. These bots have the potential to revolutionize the way we produce food, making it more sustainable and efficient.
